# Mars_Landing_page

Huge Credits to Liliia Chan on Behance for amazing design concept

Project Overview:
This concept was created to help Elon Musk (Founder, CEO and
Chief Engineer of SpaceX) get pre-orderings to travel to Mars.
The main task was to show the Red Planet the way people will
want to come to see the beauty of the mysterious world. That's
how the landing of spending a day as a Martian was started.
